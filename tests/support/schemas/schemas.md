# Schemas

The schemas in the `tests/support/schemas` folder are the JSON schemas that are used to validate the 
response from the REST APIs. The assumption is that the schemas contain valid json.

The API Tests support [JSON Schema Draft 4](http://json-schema.org/documentation.html) and that is assumed in all of the tests.
